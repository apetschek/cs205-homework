1. 255 seconds. It takes n-1 seconds to add up the totals of n bags by a single worker. Thus, 256-1 = 255 seconds.

2. 34 seconds. There are now 8 simultaneous workers counting bags. 256 / 8 = 32. Thus, each worker only needs to count 32 bags by themselves. Since everyone is counting at the same time and it is assumed each worker takes the same amount of time each to count, then we know it takes n-1 seconds to add up the totals of n bags per worker. So 32-1 equals 31 seconds per worker. We are now left with each worker, 8 in total, having a sum they have calculated. The 8 sums must now by combined into one single total, which can be done by each pair (4 in total) combining simultaneously, then each resulting pair combining together (2 in total), and finally the final pair (1 in total) combining together. That is 3 additional pairings at 1 second each, resulting in a total of 3 additional seconds for the 8 workers to communicate. So 31+3 = 34 seconds total.

3. 8 seconds. We now have an infinite supply of workers that can be used in this problem. Since the problem deals with adding two numbers together, we know that each worker (to be "working") needs at least 2 bags to count. Thus, we can take 256 / 2 = 128 workers. Thus, each worker has 2 bags to count, which happens simultaneously after 1 second. We are now left with 128 workers with 1 number each that we now have to combine. So 128 becomes 64 which becomes 32 which becomes 16 which becomes 8 which becomes 4 which becomes 2 which becomes 1. That is 7 additional seconds of counting that will take place. Thus 1+7 = 8 seconds total.

5. Accounting for communication between workers will take an additional 7 seconds, making the overall counting of 256 bags by 128 workers equal to 15 seconds. The first second of the process has no worker-worker communication, thus that step only takes one second. It is the following 7 out of the 8 total seconds that we now have an additional second added on to account for communication. Total time now equals 8+7 = 15 seconds. 

6. If I hand out 1 bag at a time to each of my cashiers, then I will be forced to add on an additional 256 seconds worth of time handing out 256 bags to each cashier. Since we know it will take 15 seconds originally (accounting for communication between cashiers), then total time will be 256 + 15 = 271 seconds. If I hand out 2 bags at a time to each cashier, then I will only be forced to add on an additional 256 / 2 = 128 seconds worth of time handing out 256 bags to each cashier (128 cashiers in total in this case). Since we know it will take 15 seconds originally (accounting for communication between cashiers), then total time will be 128 + 15 = 143 seconds. Since it takes twice as long for two workers to count two numbers together than it does for a single worker to count two numbers, my strategy would be to aim to give more bags at a time to fewer workers. This has two benefits: 1) it reduces the aforementioned communication time required and 2) i can save time handing out bags if i can give out larger batches of bags to each worker (e.g., Handing 5 bags at once takes 1 second, handing 5 bags individually takes 5 seconds).
