1. 255 seconds (4 min 15 seconds). It takes n-1 seconds to add up the totals of n bags by a single worker. Thus, 256-1 = 255 seconds.

2. 34 seconds. There are now 8 simultaneous workers counting bags. 256 / 8 = 32. Thus, each worker only needs to count 32 bags by themselves. Since everyone is counting at the same time and it is assumed each worker takes the same amount of time each to count, then we know it takes n-1 seconds to add up the totals of n bags per worker. So 32-1 equals 31 seconds per worker. We are now left with each worker, 8 in total, having a sum they have calculated. The 8 sums must now by combined into one single total, which can be done by each pair (4 in total) combining simultaneously, then each resulting pair combining (2 in total), and finally the final pair (1 in total) combining. That is 3 additional pairings at 1 second each, resulting in a total of 3 additional seconds for the 8 workers to communicate. So 31+3 = 34 seconds total.

3. 8 seconds. We now have an infinite supply of workers that can be used in this problem. Since the problem deals with adding two numbers together, we know that each worker, to be working, needs at least 2 bags to count. Thus, we can take 256 / 2 = 128 workers. Thus, each worker has 2 bags to count, which happens simultaneously after 1 second. We are now left with 128 workers with 1 number each that we now have to combine. So 128 becomes 64 which becomes 32 which becomes 16 which becomes 8 which becomes 4 which becomes 2 which becomes 1. That is 7 additional seconds. Thus 1+7 = 8 seconds.
