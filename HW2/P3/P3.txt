P3. For this question, I collaborated with Virgile Audi and Taylor Killian.

Performance increases significantly when I change the number of threads (without instruction level parallelism):
1 Thread: 4.65 seconds
2 Threads: 2.35 seconds
4 Threads: 1.22 seconds
From these results, it would appear that the speed up is about proportional to the number of threads that we implement.

When instruction level parallelism is added, performance increases even more.

1 Thread: 0.73 seconds
2 Threads: 0.37 seconds
4 Threads:  0.19 seconds

Clearly, the addition of instruction level parallelism using AVX has drastically reduced the time. With a single thread, AVX appears to improve time by a factor of 6-7. Itâ€™s likely that a full 8 is not hit because we are not always working on all 8 registers at once. There are times when some registers are above our threshold and thus using a mask allows us to avoid operating on them. perhaps we could have swapped out completed parts of the register with new ones as soon as they are ready instead of waiting for all 8 locations in the register to meet our threshold specifications before inserting in a new set of 8 into the register.
