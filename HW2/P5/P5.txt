For this problem I collaborated with Taylor Killian.

There does appear to be a difference in performance when we compare 1 threads (serial performance ) to that of 4 threads:

1 Thread: ~12 simulation frames per second
4 Threads: ~28 simulation frames per second

Note: chunk size set to (1/4)*count

This performance difference makes sense. Here we are able to distribute the work across multiple processes instead of serially in a single process (which is a lot to handle when number of balls is large). Thus, more work (i.e., simulation frames per second) can be done. Note the increase in performance is only roughly 2x better here, though we have increased the number of threads by a factor of 4.

When we introduce the grid, we see that performance increases. 

1 Thread: ~700 simulation frames per second
4 Threads: ~1800 simulation frames per second

As we can see, there is a significant speed up relative to the speeds listed above in Subproblem 1.
