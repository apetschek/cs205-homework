I experimented with various values of N locks. Specifically, I tried over the range(1,33). For medium grained uncorrelated, There seems to be a linear trend of increasing time as N increases.

For medium grained correlated, there appears to be a minimum around 14 locks. Overall, in the way in which correlated works, the increments are of 10 and thus two locks are at most 20 locks away from each other. Thus, perhaps a value of 20 here would have made more sense.
